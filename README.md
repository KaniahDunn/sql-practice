### Intro to SQL Review
SQL is a programming language designed to manipulate and manage data stored in relational databases.

A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.
A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns.
A statement is a string of characters that the database recognizes as a valid command.

* CREATE TABLE creates a new table.
* INSERT INTO adds a new row to a table.
* SELECT queries data from a table.
* ALTER TABLE changes an existing table.
* UPDATE edits a row in a table.
* DELETE FROM deletes rows from a table.
*Constraints add information about how a column can be used*

### Querying Data from the Database
We just learned how to query data from a database using SQL. We also learned how to filter queries to make the information more specific and useful.

Letâ€™s summarize:

* SELECT is the clause we use every time we want to query information from a database.
* AS renames a column or table.
* DISTINCT return unique values.
* WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
* LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators.
* AND and OR combines multiple conditions.
* ORDER BY sorts the result.
* LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows that the query will return.
* CASE creates different outputs.
